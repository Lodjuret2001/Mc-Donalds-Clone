## Overview

The project includes a clone of the McDonald's website with structured HTML and SCSS for styling. It is organized into the following sections:

- **Header**: Contains the navigation bar with links to various sections of the website.
- **Main Content**: Includes information about McDonald's food experts, chefs, dietitians, and suppliers.
- **Footer**: Displays links to privacy policies, terms and conditions, and copyright information.

## BEM Naming Convention

The project follows the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes. This convention helps maintain a clean and structured codebase.

## SCSS and Live Sass Compile

The SCSS files are organized using partials and compiled into a compressed `style.css` file using the "Live Sass Compile" extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension ensures that your styles are compressed for optimal performance.
